Created index.html page providing links for all the sample pages provided for book Modern JavaScript: Develop and Design by Larry Ullman. http://www.larryullman.com/books/modern-javascript-develop-and-design/

The Ruby script make_html_index.rb automates process of creating index.html page by searching each chapter folder for its .html pages. Execute it from the root of the examples folder or specify the root of the examples folder in the script's 1st command line argument. The resulting HTML is written to STDOUT.
